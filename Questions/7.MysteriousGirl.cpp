// SOLUTION OF SCALER CODEX 2.0 
// There are two friends Barry and Mindy. They are playing a game that consists of N rounds. 
// After playing N rounds, Mindy knows the results for each of the N rounds. She is a mysterious girl and has a superpower. 
// She can reverse the results(i.e. if currently, Barry is the winner of a round then after reversing, Mindy will be the winner of that round) of any X(X<=N) consecutive rounds from the start or the end. 
// There are two interger arrays A and B wehre A[i] and B[i] denote the winner and points of the winner of the ith round respectively.
// (if A[i] == 1 Barry is the winner else if A[i]==0 Mindy is the winner.)
// Find the maximum total points Mindy can accumulate. 
// Constraints 1<=N<=10^5, 0<=A[i]<=1,1<=B[i]<=10^4
